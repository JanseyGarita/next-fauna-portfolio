  "description": "I've been coding for about 4 years now, mostly in JavaScript, and it's frameworks. I'm from the beautiful Costa Rica. I've been always curious about how things actually work, especially tech related. I enjoy the learning process, yes, it is usually hard, but I love when I look back to the past and realize how much I've learned. Programming has become an important part of me, it's not only a job, but also a hobby. Also, I have to say that I'm a visual person, I like things to be nice and tidy. But as you might notice, I also appreciate simplicity. I hope I can transmit all of that through this website :)"
